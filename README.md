## Features

CHReader reads files contained in a local folder and writes them into a compressed archive that can be accessed, with its own embedded web server, using your preferred internet browser. This way you can store very large static web sites in an optimal space-saving way.

Compiling a source folder means a complete scan (along with all of its subfolders) in search of every existing file (html files, jpeg images, zip archives, etc...) and a build of a single compressed archive optimized for fast directory searches and high speed browsing.

Browsing a source archive means activating the web server embedded in this application and linking it to a previously compiled archive file. The compiled web site can be then accessed at the address http://localhost:8971/index.html.

## Download

All versions of CHReader can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/mayakron/chreader/releases).

## Installation

CHReader is portable: just expand the archive to a directory of your choice and run the CHReader.exe file.
